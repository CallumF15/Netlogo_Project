About:

A project focused on using Artficial Intelligence (AI) to create a simple capture the flag game. There is 2 teams that are all controlled by the AI pathfinding and a finite-state machine system. 
The finite state machine takes into consideration the proximity of enemy players when a player is currently carrying the flag so they can evade, and various other states to try make the game seem somewhat natural
